Today's lesson is to create a server for a bank.

The bank has provided you with its name, location, branch, phone, address, accountnumber.
To build the server, map out the structure of the architecture.
Server ---> Router --> Controller --> Service --> Repository --> Database then...
Database ---> Repository --> Service --> Controller --> Router --> Server

So, import express, body parser and cors.
create a server and let server use the body parser.
Note that the body parser is used to parse the body of the request.

Let the server listen to a port of your choice.
